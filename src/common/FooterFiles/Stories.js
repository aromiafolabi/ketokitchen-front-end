      <p>I am trying my damndest to cut down on carbs. To be honest, I really havent been strict since hitting my first ketoversary in May. I was like “I lost 150lbs” and went straight into maintenance. Part of me worries about loose skin -and part of me uses that as an excuse to be lax. I will tell myself I dont want to rush so my body can catch up and hopefully reduce loose skin -aaaand, that is okay, but I *think* I want to pick back up again. I will say, I cannot BELIEVE I eat the way I do without gaining weight. That is completely new to me. I dont think Ive ever eaten with such abandon. Ever. And I havent gained weight! I eat so many sweets and chocolates -I love the low-carb options available and I love that although I “fell off the wagon” for 6-7 months and basically ate whatever (keto food) I wanted (I do NOT eat keto sweets in moderation -I shove my face on the reg, I didnt gain weight back. Im heartily comforted that maintenance and higher carb counts is not only feasible -but also quite enjoyable. I think this is possibly a sign my insulin resistance may be a thing of the past? Anywho, after 7 months of no restrictions, Im debating tightening down the hatches again. All in all, and I know this conflicts with the above, Im actually pretty damn happy with my current weight. Maybe this is my new norm. Well see. Anyone else struggling with maintenance and fluctuating goal weights? My initial goal weight was 175, and then moved to 200. I currently weigh 250lbs, fluctuating +/- 10lbs. .</p>

      <p>A little before and after.. 108lb difference between the 2 photos. Although it look totally different now, the biggest change has come from my lifestyle changes, carbs V low carb. The photo on the right is me tonight having got back from a 5 mile run tonight.
      Before anyone steels my photo and tries to sell you some 28 day plan - let me tell you you dont need any plan to follow, just read (for free) on the internet about a ketogenic diet decide to start, a go for it! If I can do it so can you.

          Transformation Tuesday<br/>
          Where do I even begin?! 23 years old on the left going through the motions of life—crying myself to sleep heartache after heartache—hardship after hardship. I didnt have an “easy” life growing up and food has been my comfort for as long as I can remember. The thing about life is that the heartaches and the hardships dont stop.
        <br/>

          My idea of “healthy eating” was low fat—carby and full of sugar and maintaining my weight was never attainable. The first week I started the ketogenic diet I felt like I had been cured of an addition to sugar and grains. Ive been living a ketogenic lifestyle for 2 years now and its the best decision Ive ever made.
        <br/>

          Ive been dealing with emotional eating my entire life even to this day! Every day is a struggle but you get to a point where you say enough is enough. Be better than falling victim to lifes pain because life is TOO SHORT.
        <br/>

          Losing my dad so suddenly to a stroke forever changed me. Every morning as a young teenager Id watch him inject himself with insulin and he would constantly remind me to take care of my health because he didnt want me to end up like him—with high blood pressure, diabetes and multiple heart surgeries. I was more depressed than I had ever been when he passed away and I made the decision to pull myself out of that. You can too.

        Havent shared one like this in a while. I was feeling down on myself and felt like I had made no progress.
        <br/>
        But I looked back at the beginning of my keto journey on the left in 2018 (I was already down about 20lbs) and I see how much my body has changed over the last year and a half and Im blown away.
        <br/>

        Im not at my goal yet. Im not even sure what that goal is yet. But Im miles from where I started.
        <br/>
        
        My fire has been reignited and I cant wait to see how my progress continues!
        <br/>

        Down 9 lbs in the last week y all. Its insane  but I feel amazing. So grateful for the energy and focus Im feeling these days. I am ON POINT and embracing what works for me.

        #TRANSFORMATION STORY PLEASE READ: I used to be severely overweight for a period of my life (probably considered obese). Some people have known me a long time and have seen my #progress, but some only know me now and dont know what I used to be. There are a few years of my life with zero to very few pictures of me because I hated the way I looked. After getting out of a toxic relationship (when I ate my feelings out of depression), I was able to lose a little bit on my own by focusing on #me and getting back into activities I loved (musical theater) and overall being happy again. But I was still overweight and sort of hit a plateau, so I gave up on trying because nothing seemed to be working. It wasnt until October of 2016 that I learned about the #ketogenic lifestyle and started that way of eating and was able to lose 10 pounds in 2 months, just from making better food choices. In January of 2017, I began a fitness regime, going to the #gym about 4-5 days a week doing a mix of weight lifting and cardio. My plan was to hit my #goal weight within one year. (To be honest, I didnt think I was going to do it, but told myself Id be happy if I got close.) Its been one year since I did my first #workout on my own and I am so excited to say that I did it...I HIT MY GOAL WEIGHT!!! From June 2015 to now, I have lost about 76 pounds/7 dress sizes and Im a happier, healthier, and stronger version of myself than I ever was before! Its not just about the number and how I look, but Ive learned that I need to take care of my body from the inside out for #health reasons too. I now have more energy and I feel absolutely amazing. I finally feel like the version of myself that I always envisioned in my head. This has been a long and hard #journey and there were many times I thought I might give up. Im sharing these pictures not out of vanity, but because Im just so #happy that I did it and I want people to know that you can do whatever you set your mind to!!
