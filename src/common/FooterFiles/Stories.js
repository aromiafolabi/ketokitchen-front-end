              <p className="card-text">I am trying my damndest to cut down on carbs. To be honest, I really havent been strict since hitting my first ketoversary in May. I was like “I lost 150lbs” and went straight into maintenance. <br />
          Part of me worries about loose skin and part of me uses that as an excuse to be lax. <br />
          I will tell myself I dont want to rush so my body can catch up and hopefully reduce loose skin and that is okay, but I think I want to pick back up again. <br />
          I will say, I cannot BELIEVE I eat the way I do without gaining weight. That is completely new to me. I dont think Ive ever eaten with such abandonment. Ever. And I havent gained weight! <br />
          I eat so many sweets and chocolates. I love the low-carb options available and I love that although I “fell off the wagon” for 6-7 months and basically ate any keto approved meals I wanted, I did not gain weight back. <br />
          Anyone else struggling with maintenance and fluctuating goal weights? My initial goal weight was 175, I currently weigh 200lbs! nearly there!.</p>

              <p className="card-text">A little before and after.. 108lb difference between the 2 photos. Although it look totally different now, the biggest change has come from my lifestyle changes, carbs V low carb. The photo on the right is me tonight having got back from a 5 mile run tonight.
      Before anyone steels my photo and tries to sell you some 28 day plan - let me tell you you dont need any plan to follow, just read (for free) on the internet about a ketogenic diet decide to start, a go for it! If I can do it so can you.

          Where do I even begin?! 23 years old on the left going through the motions of life—crying myself to sleep heartache after heartache—hardship after hardship. I didnt have an “easy” life growing up and food has been my comfort for as long as I can remember. The thing about life is that the heartaches and the hardships dont stop.
                <br/>
          My idea of “healthy eating” was low fat—carby and full of sugar and maintaining my weight was never attainable. The first week I started the ketogenic diet I felt like I had been cured of an addiction to sugar and grains. I have been living a ketogenic lifestyle for 2 years now and it is the best decision I have ever made.
                <br/>
          Ive been dealing with emotional eating my entire life even to this day! Every day is a struggle but you get to a point where you say enough is enough. Be better than falling victim to lifes pain because life is TOO SHORT.
                <br/>
          Losing my dad so suddenly to a stroke forever changed me. Every morning as a young teenager i would watch him inject himself with insulin and he would constantly remind me to take care of my health because he didnt want me to end up like him—with high blood pressure, diabetes and multiple heart surgeries. I was more depressed than I had ever been when he passed away and I made the decision to pull myself out of that. You can too.
