        What is a <strong>Keto Diet?</strong>
      </h1>

      <img src='../assets/wik-1.jpg' />

      <p id='wik-p'>A keto diet is well known for   being a low carb diet,   where the body produces ketones in the liver to be used as energy. Its referred to as many different names - ketogenic diet, low carb diet, low carb high fat (LCHF), etc.
      </p>
      <container id='wik-glucose'>
        <p>
          When you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose and insulin.
        </p>
        <ul id='wik-ul'>
          <li>
            Glucose is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that it will be chosen over any other energy source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insulin is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by taking it around the body.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </container>

      <p id='wik-p'>
        Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.
        <br />
        Ketosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low. During this state, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver.
        <br />
        The end goal of a properly maintained keto diet is to force your body into this metabolic state. We dont do this through starvation of calories but starvation of carbohydrates.
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-2.jpg' />

      <p id='wik-p'>
        Our bodies are incredibly adaptive to what you put into it - when you overload it with fats and take away carbohydrates, it will begin to burn ketones as the primary energy source. Optimal ketone levels offer many health, weight loss, physical and mental performance benefits.

        <strong>What Do I eat</strong> on a Keto Diet?
      </h1>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-3.jpg' />

      <p id='wik-p'>
        To start a keto diet, you will want to plan ahead. That means having a viable diet plan ready and waiting. What you eat depends on how fast you want to get into a ketogenic state (ketosis). The more restrictive you are on your carbohydrates (less than 25g net carbs per day), the faster you will enter ketosis. Learn which foods to avoid on the keto diet. <br />

        You want to keep your carbohydrates limited, coming mostly from vegetables, nuts, and dairy. Dont eat any refined carbohydrates such as wheat (bread, pasta, cereals), starch (potatoes, beans, legumes) or fruit. The small exceptions to this are avocado, star fruit, and berries which can be consumed in moderation.

      <p id='wik-p'>
      Try to remember that keto is high in fat, moderate in protein, and very low in carbs. Your nutrient intake should be something around 70% fats, 25% protein, and 5% carbohydrate.<br />

      Typically, anywhere between 20-30g of net carbs is recommended for everyday dieting - but the lower you keep your carbohydrate intake and glucose levels, the better the overall results will be. If you are doing keto for weight loss, it is a good idea to keep track of both your total carbs and net carbs.<br/>

      Protein should always be consumed as needed with fat filling in the remainder of the calories in your day.<br/>

      You might be asking, “What is a net carb?” It is simple really! The net carbs are your total dietary carbohydrates, minus the total fiber. I recommend keeping total carbs below 35g and net carbs below 25g (ideally, below 20g).<br/>

      If you are finding yourself hungry throughout the day, you can snack on nuts, seeds, cheeses, or almond butter to curb your appetite (though snacking can slow progress in the long term). Sometimes we can confuse the want to snack with the need for a meal. 
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>Vegetables on a Ketogenic Diet</h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
      Dark green and leafy is always the best choice for vegetables. Most of your meals should be a protein with vegetables, and an extra side of fat. Chicken thighs basted in olive oil, with broccoli and cheese. Steak topped with a knob of butter, and a side of spinach sauteed in olive oil.<br/>

      If you are still confused about what a net carb is, dont worry - I will explain further. Lets say for example you want to eat some broccoli (1 cup) - one of my favorite keto vegetables out there.
      </p>
      <ul id='wik-ul'>
        <li>
        There are a total of 6g carbohydrates in 1 cup.
        </li>
        <li>
        There is also 2g of fiber in 1 cup.
        </li>
        <li>
        So, we take the 6g (total carbs) and subtract the 2g (dietary fiber).
        </li>
        <li>
        This will give us our net carbs of 4g.

          Benefits
        </strong> 
        of a Ketogenic Diet
      </h1>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        There are numerous benefits that come with being on keto: from weight loss and increased energy levels to therapeutic medical applications. Most anyone can safely benefit from eating a low-carb, high-fat diet. Below, you will find a short list of the benefits you can receive from a ketogenic diet.
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Weight Loss
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
      The ketogenic diet essentially uses your body fat as an energy source - so there are obvious weight loss benefits. On keto, your insulin (the fat-storing hormone) levels drop greatly which turns your body into a fat-burning machine.<br/>

      Scientifically, the ketogenic diet has shown better results compared to low-fat and high-carb diets; even in the long term. 
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-5.jpg'/>

      <p id='wik-p'>
        Many people incorporate MCT Oil into their diet (it increases ketone production and fat loss) by drinking ketoproof coffee in the morning
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Control Blood Sugar
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        Keto naturally lowers blood sugar levels due to the type of foods you eat. Studies even show that the ketogenic diet is a more effective way to manage and prevent diabetes compared to low-calorie diets.<br/>

        If you are pre-diabetic or have Type II diabetes, you should seriously consider a ketogenic diet. We have many readers that have had success with their blood sugar control on keto. 
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-6.jpg' />

      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Mental Focus
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        Many people use the ketogenic diet specifically for increased mental performance.<br/>

        Ketones are a great source of fuel for the brain. When you lower carb intake, you avoid big spikes in blood sugar. Together, this can result in improved focus and concentration.<br/>

        Studies show that an increased intake of fatty acids can have impacting benefits to our brains function.
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-7.jpg' />
      
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Increase Energy & Normalized Hunger
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        By giving your body a better and more reliable energy source, you will feel more energized during the day. Fats are shown to be the most effective molecule to burn as fuel.<br/>

        On top of that, fat is naturally more satisfying and ends up leaving us in a satiated (“full”) state for longer. 
      </p>

      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Epilepsy
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        The ketogenic diet has been used since the early 1900s to treat epilepsy successfully. It is still one of the most widely used therapies for children who have uncontrolled epilepsy today.
        <br/>

        One of the main benefits of the ketogenic diet and epilepsy is that it allows fewer medications to be used while still offering excellent control.
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-9.jpg'/>

      <p id='wik-p'>
        In the last few years, studies have also shown significant result in adults treated with keto as well.
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Cholesterol & Blood Pressure
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        A keto diet has shown to improve triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels most associated with arterial buildup. More specifically low-carb, high-fat diets show a dramatic increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL particle concentration compared to low-fat diets.
        <br/> 

        Many studies on ketogenic diets also show better improvement in blood pressure over other diets.
      </p>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-10.jpg'/>

      <p id='wik-p'>
        Some blood pressure issues are associated with excess weight, which is a bonus since keto tends to lead to weight loss. 
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        Insulin Resistance
      </h6>
      <p id='wik'>
        Insulin resistance can lead to type II diabetes if left unmanaged. An abundant amount of research shows that a low carb, ketogenic diet can help people lower their insulin levels to healthy ranges.<br/>

        Even if you are athletic, you can benefit from insulin optimization on keto through eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.

        Acne
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        It is common to experience improvements in your skin when you switch to a keto diet.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>Here is <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327146'>one study</a> that shows drops in lesions and skin inflammation when switching to a low-carb diet. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17448569'>Another study</a> that shows a probable connection between high-carb eating and increased acne, so it is likely that keto can help.

        How to Reach <strong>Ketosis</strong>
      </h1>

      <img src='../../assets/wik-13.jpg'/>

      <container id='wik-p-with-ol'>
        <p id='wik-p'>
          Achieving ketosis is pretty straightforward, but it can seem complicated and confusing with all of the information out there.4 Here is the bottom line on what you need to do, ordered in levels of importance:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Restrict your carbohydrates.</strong> Most people tend to only focus only on net carbs. If you want great results, limit both. Try to stay below 20g net carbs and below 35g total carbs per day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Restrict your protein intake.</strong>
            Many people come over to keto from an Atkins diet and dont limit their protein. Too much protein can lead to lower levels of ketosis. Ideally, you want to eat between 0.6g and 0.8g protein per pound lean body mass. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stop worrying about fat.</strong>
            Fat is the primary source of energy on keto - so make sure you are feeding your body enough of it. You do not lose weight on keto through starvation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drink water.</strong>
            Try to drink a gallon of water a day. Make sure that you are hydrating and staying consistent with the amount of water you drink. It not only helps regulate many vital bodily functions, but it also helps control hunger levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stop snacking.</strong>
            Weight loss tends to do better when you have fewer insulin spikes during the day. Unnecessary snacking may lead to stalls or slow in progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start fasting.</strong>
            Fasting can be a great tool to boost ketone levels consistently throughout the day. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add exercise in.</strong>
            It is a known fact that exercise is healthy. If you want to get the most out of your ketogenic diet, consider adding in 20-30 minutes of exercise a day. Even just a small walk can help regulate weight loss and blood sugar levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start supplementing.</strong>
            Although not usually needed, supplementing can help with a ketogenic diet. 
          </li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Optimal Ketosis</strong> and Macros
      </h1>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        There are so many tricks, shortcuts, and gimmicks out there on achieving optimal ketosis - I would suggest you dont bother with any of that. Optimal ketosis can be accomplished through dietary nutrition alone (aka just eating food). You shouldnt need a magic pill to do it. Just stay strict, remain vigilant, and be focused on recording what you eat (to make sure your carb and protein intake are correct).
      </p>
      <h6 id='wik-h-small'>
        How to Know if You are in Ketosis
      </h6>
      <p id='wik-p'>
        You can measure if you are in ketosis via urine or blood strips, though it is not really worth it. The urine strips are considered pretty inaccurate (they more answer the question “Am I in ketosis?”), and the blood strips are expensive (up to $5 per strip).
      </p>
      <container id='wik-ul'>
        <p>
          Instead, you can use this short list of physical “symptoms” that usually let you know if you are on the right track:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased Urination.</strong> Keto is a natural diuretic, so you have to go to the bathroom more. Acetoacetate, a ketone body, is also excreted in urination and can lead to increased bathroom visits for beginners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dry Mouth.</strong> The increased urination leads to dry mouth and increased thirst. Make sure that you are drinking plenty of water and replenishing your electrolytes (salt, potassium, magnesium).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bad Breath.</strong> Acetone is a ketone body that partially excretes in our breath. It can smell sharp like overripe fruit, similar to nail polish remover. It is usually temporary and goes away long term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Hunger & Increased Energy.</strong> Usually, after you get past the “keto flu,” you will experience a much lower hunger level and a “clear” or energized mental state.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most people end up driving themselves crazy measuring and testing. It is much better to focus on the nutritional aspect, making sure that you are in taking proper foods and staying within your macro ranges (read below).

        Types of <strong>Ketogenic Diets</strong>?
      </h1>
      <img src='../../assets/wik-15.jpg'/>
      <container id='wik-ul'>
        <p>
        Many people ask if carbs are needed to build muscle. Of course, they are not. If you are asking this question, I will assume you know how you gain mass.<br/>

        Your glycogen stores can still be refilled while on a ketogenic diet. A keto diet is an excellent way to build muscle, but protein intake is crucial here. It is suggested that if you are looking to gain mass, you should be taking in about 1.0 - 1.2g protein per lean pound of body mass. Putting muscle on may be slower on a ketogenic diet, but that is because your total body fat is not increasing as much.
          <br/>

        If for some reason you need to put on body fat also, you can achieve your goals through different types of a Ketogenic Diet. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Standard Ketogenic Diet (SKD):</strong> This is the classic keto diet that everyone knows and does. It is the “bread and butter” of this website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Targeted Ketogenic Diet (TKD)</strong>: This is a variation where you eat SKD, but intake a small amount of fast-digesting carbs before a workout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD)</strong>: This is a variation of keto for bodybuilders and contest goers, generally giving one day a week to carb up and resupply glycogen stores.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </container>
      <h1 id='wik-h-large'>
        physical <strong>Performance</strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
        People often argue that performance is affected when on a keto diet, but that is not true. Well, not in the long run. In the short-term, you may notice some small physical performance drops, but this will subside as you continue replenishing fluids, electrolytes, and adapt to the fat intake.
        <br/>

        Many studies have been done on exercise. A study was done on trained cyclists who were on a ketogenic diet for four weeks. The results show that aerobic endurance was not compromised at all, and their muscle mass was the same as when they started.
        <br/>
      </p>
      <img src='../../assets/wik-16.jpg'/>
      <p>
        Their bodies adapted through ketosis, limiting both glucose and glycogen stores, and used fats as the predominant energy source.
        <br/>

        There was another study done on eight professional gymnasts who had the same results. Both groups were fed a strict diet of green vegetables, proteins, and high-quality fats. So, even if you are doing long bouts of cardio - a keto diet has been proven time and time again.
        <br/>

        The only real time where ketosis can give performance loss is in exercises that need an explosive action. If you need a little boost in your performance during these, you can “carb-up” by eating 25-50g of carbs about 30 minutes before you train.

        <h1>
          Danger of a <strong>Keto Diet</strong>
        </h1>
        <img src='../../assets/wik-17.jpg' />

        <p>
          Can ketone production in the body get too high? Yes, it is called ketoacidosis. Is it likely under normal circumstances? Not at all. For most people, it is a challenge just to get into optimal ranges for ketosis. Getting into territory where you need medical intervention is just not likely.
          <br/>

          NOTE: <em>The main exception to ketoacidosis is type 1 diabetics - it can happen when insulin levels are severely low which is rare in someone with a normally functioning pancreas. Dangerously high ketone levels result in insulin secretion.</em>
          <br/>

          There are a lot of misconceptions about low carb dieting which has caused an infamous outlook on keto. There have been tons of studies published over the last 30 years that show how high amounts of fat and few carbs are beneficial.
          <br/>

          People sometimes get keto confused with high fat, high carb diets which are terrible for the body. Of course, when you eat a lot of fatty foods that are high in sugar, you will be getting yourself into trouble.
          <br/>

          Have you been thinking of going on a low-fat diet? It is been shown that a <strong>ketogenic diet is both healthier and more effective than low-fat dieting.</strong>
          <br/>

          When you eat foods high in carbohydrates and fat, your body naturally produces glucose. Carbohydrates are the easiest thing for the body to process, and therefore it will use them first - resulting in the excess fats to be stored immediately. In turn, this causes weight gain and health problems that are associated with high fat, high carbohydrate diets (NOT a keto diet).
          <br/>

          As a precaution, you should always check with your physician if you have any concerns about starting a keto diet. You should especially be wary if you are currently taking medications for a pre-existing condition as extra monitoring may be needed. Be careful when breastfeeding as you may need to increase carb intake.

        <h1>
          <strong>What Happens</strong> To My Body
        </h1>
        <p>
          Your body is used to the simple routine of breaking down carbohydrates and using them as energy. Over time the body has built up an arsenal of enzymes ready for this process and only has a few enzymes for dealing with fats - mostly to store them.
        </p>
        <img src='../../assets/wik-18.jpg'/>
        <p>
          All of a sudden your body has to deal with the lack of glucose and increase in fats, which means building up a new supply of enzymes. As your body becomes induced into a ketogenic state, your body will naturally use what is left of your glucose.

          This means your body will be depleted of glycogen in the muscles - which can cause a lack of energy and general lethargy.

          In the first week, many people report headaches, mental fogginess, dizziness, and aggravation. Most of the time, this is the result of your electrolytes being flushed out, as ketosis has a diuretic effect. Make sure you drink plenty of water and keep your sodium intake up.
          <br/>

          In fact, you should go overboard with the salt - salt everything! Sodium will help with water retention and help replenish the electrolytes. For most, this temporary groggy feeling is the biggest danger you are going to face. It is called the “Keto Flu.”

          Keto flu is a very common experience for people new to a ketogenic diet, but it often goes away after just a few days - and there are ways to minimize or even eliminate it. When transitioning to keto, you may feel some slight discomfort including fatigue, headache, nausea, cramps, etc.

            There are a few reasons for the keto flue, but the two primary ones are:

            <li>
              <strong>The keto diet is a diuretic.</strong> You tend to go to the bathroom more to urinate, which attributes to a loss of both electrolytes and water in your body. You can usually help combat this by either drinking bouillon cube or Powerade Zero and by increasing your water intake. Mainly, you want to replenish your depleted electrolytes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You are transitioning.</strong> Your body is equipped to process a high intake of carbs and a lower intake of fat. Your body needs to create enzymes to be able to do this. In the transitional period, the brain may run low on energy which can lead to grogginess, nausea, and headaches. If you are having a large problem with this, you can choose to reduce carb intake gradually.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          After increasing water intake and replacing electrolytes, it should relieve most all symptoms of Keto Flu. For an average person that is starting a ketogenic diet, eating 20-30g of net carbs a day, the entire adaptation process will take about 4-5 days. My advice is to cut your carbs to fewer than 15g to ensure that you are well on your way into ketosis within one week. If you are experiencing any more keto flu symptoms, double check your electrolyte intake and adjust.

          You may notice that if you are an avid gym-goer, you lost some strength and endurance. A temporary decrease in physical performance is typical. Once your body becomes keto-adapted, your body will be able to fully utilize fat as its primary source of energy.

          Common Side Effect on a <strong>Keto Diet</strong>

        <p>
          Here are a few of the most common side effects that I come across when people first start keto. Frequently the issues relate to dehydration or lack of micronutrients (vitamins) in the body. Make sure that you are drinking enough water (close to a gallon a day) and eating foods with good sources of micronutrients.
