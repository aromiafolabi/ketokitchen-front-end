            <p>A keto diet is well known for   being a low carb diet,   where the body produces ketones in the liver to be used as energy. Its referred to as many different names - ketogenic diet, low carb diet, low carb high fat (LCHF), etc.

            <p>
        Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.
              <br />
        Ketosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low. During this state, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver.
              <br />
        The end goal of a properly maintained keto diet is to force your body into this metabolic state. We dont do this through starvation of calories but starvation of carbohydrates.

            </div>
            <p>
        Our bodies are incredibly adaptive to what you put into it - when you overload it with fats and take away carbohydrates, it will begin to burn ketones as the primary energy source. Optimal ketone levels offer many health, weight loss, physical and mental performance benefits.

        To start a keto diet, you will want to plan ahead. That means having a viable diet plan ready and waiting. What you eat depends on how fast you want to get into a ketogenic state (ketosis). The more restrictive you are on your carbohydrates (less than 25g net carbs per day), the faster you will enter ketosis. Learn which foods to avoid on the keto diet. <br />

        You want to keep your carbohydrates limited, coming mostly from vegetables, nuts, and dairy. Dont eat any refined carbohydrates such as wheat (bread, pasta, cereals), starch (potatoes, beans, legumes) or fruit. The small exceptions to this are avocado, star fruit, and berries which can be consumed in moderation.

      Try to remember that keto is high in fat, moderate in protein, and very low in carbs. Your nutrient intake should be something around 70% fats, 25% protein, and 5% carbohydrate.<br />

      Typically, anywhere between 20-30g of net carbs is recommended for everyday dieting - but the lower you keep your carbohydrate intake and glucose levels, the better the overall results will be. If you are doing keto for weight loss, it is a good idea to keep track of both your total carbs and net carbs.<br/>

      Protein should always be consumed as needed with fat filling in the remainder of the calories in your day.<br/>

      You might be asking, “What is a net carb?” It is simple really! The net carbs are your total dietary carbohydrates, minus the total fiber. I recommend keeping total carbs below 35g and net carbs below 25g (ideally, below 20g).<br/>

      If you are finding yourself hungry throughout the day, you can snack on nuts, seeds, cheeses, or almond butter to curb your appetite (though snacking can slow progress in the long term). Sometimes we can confuse the want to snack with the need for a meal. 
            </p>
            <h6>Vegetables on a Ketogenic Diet</h6>
            <p>
      Dark green and leafy is always the best choice for vegetables. Most of your meals should be a protein with vegetables, and an extra side of fat. Chicken thighs basted in olive oil, with broccoli and cheese. Steak topped with a knob of butter, and a side of spinach sauteed in olive oil.<br/>

      If you are still confused about what a net carb is, dont worry - I will explain further. Lets say for example you want to eat some broccoli (1 cup) - one of my favorite keto vegetables out there.

            <h1><strong>Benefits</strong> of a Ketogenic Diet</h1>
            <p>
        There are numerous benefits that come with being on keto: from weight loss and increased energy levels to therapeutic medical applications. Most anyone can safely benefit from eating a low-carb, high-fat diet. Below, you will find a short list of the benefits you can receive from a ketogenic diet.
            </p>
            <h6>
        Weight Loss
            </h6>
            <p>
      The ketogenic diet essentially uses your body fat as an energy source - so there are obvious weight loss benefits. On keto, your insulin (the fat-storing hormone) levels drop greatly which turns your body into a fat-burning machine.<br/>

      Scientifically, the ketogenic diet has shown better results compared to low-fat and high-carb diets; even in the long term. 
            </p>
            <div className='col-md-4'>
              <img src='../assets/wik-5.jpeg' className='card-img-top' alt='weight measurement' />
            </div>
            <p>
        Many people incorporate MCT Oil into their diet (it increases ketone production and fat loss) by drinking ketoproof coffee in the morning
            </p>
            <h6>
        Control Blood Sugar
            </h6>
            <p>
        Keto naturally lowers blood sugar levels due to the type of foods you eat. Studies even show that the ketogenic diet is a more effective way to manage and prevent diabetes compared to low-calorie diets.<br/>

        If you are pre-diabetic or have Type II diabetes, you should seriously consider a ketogenic diet. We have many readers that have had success with their blood sugar control on keto. 
            </p>

              <img src='../assets/wik-6.jpeg' className='card-img-top' alt='blood test'/>
            </div>
            <h6>
        Mental Focus
            </h6>
            <p>
        Many people use the ketogenic diet specifically for increased mental performance.<br/>

        Ketones are a great source of fuel for the brain. When you lower carb intake, you avoid big spikes in blood sugar. Together, this can result in improved focus and concentration.<br/>

        Studies show that an increased intake of fatty acids can have impacting benefits to our brains function.

            </div>
            <h6>
        Increase Energy & Normalized Hunger
            </h6>
            <p>
        By giving your body a better and more reliable energy source, you will feel more energized during the day. Fats are shown to be the most effective molecule to burn as fuel.<br/>

        On top of that, fat is naturally more satisfying and ends up leaving us in a satiated (“full”) state for longer.

            </div>
            <h6>
        Epilepsy
            </h6>
            <p>
        The ketogenic diet has been used since the early 1900s to treat epilepsy successfully. It is still one of the most widely used therapies for children who have uncontrolled epilepsy today.
              <br/>

        One of the main benefits of the ketogenic diet and epilepsy is that it allows fewer medications to be used while still offering excellent control.
            </p>
            <div className='col-md-4'>
              <img src='../assets/wik-9.jpeg' className='card-img-top' alt='child'/>
            </div>
            <p>
        In the last few years, studies have also shown significant result in adults treated with keto as well.
            </p>
            <h6>
        Cholesterol & Blood Pressure
            </h6>
            <p>
        A keto diet has shown to improve triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels most associated with arterial buildup. More specifically low-carb, high-fat diets show a dramatic increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL particle concentration compared to low-fat diets.
              <br/> 

        Many studies on ketogenic diets also show better improvement in blood pressure over other diets.
            </p>
            <div className='col-md-4'>
              <img src='../assets/wik-10.jpeg' className='card-img-top' alt='blood pressure measure'/>
            </div>
            <p>
        Some blood pressure issues are associated with excess weight, which is a bonus since keto tends to lead to weight loss. 
            </p>
            <h6>
        Insulin Resistance
            </h6>
            <p>
        Insulin resistance can lead to type II diabetes if left unmanaged. An abundant amount of research shows that a low carb, ketogenic diet can help people lower their insulin levels to healthy ranges.<br/>

        Even if you are athletic, you can benefit from insulin optimization on keto through eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.
            </p>

            <h6>
        Acne
            </h6>
            <p>
        It is common to experience improvements in your skin when you switch to a keto diet.
            </p>
            <br/>

            <p>Here is <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22327146'>one study</a> that shows drops in lesions and skin inflammation when switching to a low-carb diet. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17448569'>Another study</a> that shows a probable connection between high-carb eating and increased acne, so it is likely that keto can help.
